<p> Hello! I recently completed my undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley (Class of 2020) in Statistics.
Starting in Fall 2020 I will be a PhD Student in the Department of Statistics and
Applied Probability at UCSB; this website will be updated in the coming months accordingly. </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p> <u> All Models are Wrong: Concepts of Statistical Learning (CSL)</u>, by Sanchez, G. and Marzban, E.
      <form action="http://allmodelsarewrong.github.io/" style='display:inline;'>

      </form>
    </p>
      <p> While at UC Berkeley, I had the pleasure of working with Dr. Gaston Sanchez to co-author an
      electronic Machine Learning textbook, modeled after class notes from Stat 154 (the designated
      Machine Learning class in the Statistics Department at UC Berkeley). The textbook is freely available for use, and is updated/revised from time to time.</p>

      <p> <u> Statistics Undergraduate Student Association (SUSA),</u> at UC Berkeley

      <p> I was fortunate enough to serve as a founding member of (and also Secretary for) the Statistics Undergraduate Student Association
      (SUSA) at UC Berkeley, which is the officially supported student association of the Statistics Department at UC Berkeley. Additionally,
      I wrote a handful of exam review sheets, which can be found on the official SUSA website. </p>

  <li>
      <p> <u> Music 198: Chamber Music For Fun</u>, at UC Berkeley </p>
      <p> From August 2018 until my graduaton in May 2020, I served as one of three "facilitators" (akin to instructors) for Music 198, which is a one-unit class
      (taken for a P/NP grade) in which students of any level of musical experience can come together and engage collaboratively in Chamber Music.
      Duties as a facilitator included judging auditions, organizing the final recitals, and other administrative work. </p>

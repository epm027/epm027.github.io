  <p> Hello! I started in the the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability
  at the University of California, Santa Barbara as a PhD Student in Fall 2020.
  Prior to that, I completed my Undergraduate Degree at the University of California,
  Berkeley (also in Statistics). </p>

     <p> While at UC Berkeley, I had the pleasure of working with Dr. Gaston Sanchez to co-author an
      electronic Machine Learning textbook, modeled after class notes from Stat 154 (the designated
      Machine Learning class in the Statistics Department at UC Berkeley). The textbook is freely
      available for use, and is updated/revised from time to time. </p>

      <p> I was fortunate enough to serve as a founding member of (and also Secretary for) the Statistics Undergraduate Student Association
      (SUSA) at UC Berkeley, which is the officially supported student association of the Statistics Department at UC Berkeley. Additionally,
      I wrote a handful of exam review sheets, which can be found on the official SUSA website. </p>

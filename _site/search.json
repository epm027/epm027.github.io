LaTeX is a markup language used primarily to generate mathematical documents, and includes extensive support for typesetting equations. Overleaf (which, fun fact, was called “ShareLaTeX” back when I started using it) is an online interface which can be used to generate LaTeX documents without having to download any software on your computer, and also provides a very useful “Learn LaTeX in 30 minutes” guide.\n\n\n\nOverleaf\n\n\n\n\nLearn LaTeX in 30 minutes"

## Welcome to the SBSI!

- My name is Ethan (he/him); I'm a fourth-year PhD student in the PSTAT Department.

- I co-founded this student chapter along with Dr. Uma Ravat (an Assistant Teaching Professor, also in the PSTAT department) over the summer.

- I'd like to tell y'all a bit more about what this means!

## The ASA

## The ASA

- From the [ASA Website](https://www.amstat.org/about-asa):

:::{.fragment}
> "The American Statistical Association is the world’s largest community of statisticians, the “Big Tent for Statistics.” It is the second-oldest, continuously operating professional association in the country. [...] Our members serve in industry, government, and academia in more than 90 countries, advancing research and promoting sound statistical practice to inform public policy and improve human welfare.

## The ASA

- So, all around a great organization to align with if you have any interest in statistics and/or data science!

- Typically, joining the ASA comes at a cost of \$25-30. By being a member of an officially-registered Student Chapter, you get a 20\% discount on membership!


## SBSI

- This is where the Santa Barbara Statistics Initiative (SBSI) comes in.

- If you choose to join the SBSI, you will indeed qualify for the 20\% discounted membership (we'll talk more about joining the SBSI in a bit).

## SBSI

- But wait- aren't there a bunch of clubs and student organizations already in existence that are affiliated with the PSTAT department?

- Yes- there are many! And we do not want to step on anyones toes, so-to-speak.

    - Rather, we hope to collaborate with as many of these organizations as possible, as none of them have an ASA affiliation.
    
## SBSI

- And there are definite perks to ASA affiliation! 

- In addition to the discounted membership mentioned before, members of ASA student chapters get exclusive access to resources, like access to a dedicated pool of speakers and experts.

- We'll also strive to have some social events for our members as well, just to add that little bit of extra spice!

## SBSI: Goals

- So, what are we our specific goals as the SBSI?

- Loosely speaking, we hope to:

    - Act as an 'umbrella organization', aiding and unifying the already-existing student organizations
    
    - Host additional events
    
    - Foster a greater sense of community between *all* statistics enthusiasts (undergrad and graduate alike!)


## SBSI: What We Plan to Do {style="font-size:35px"}

- Our current more concrete plans include:

    - Collaborating with DS Collab to provide greater hands-on experience with data science-driven projects
    
    - Hosting a handful of speakers and panels with experts in the field (and possibly the industry as well)
    
    - Bringing a DataFest to UCSB (tentative... but hopeful!)
    
    - Bringing an Integration Bee-like event to UCSB
    
    

## SBSI: What We Plan to Do

- We also want to know what y'all want! 

    - Let us know if there is something specific you would like to see happen, and we would be happy to work together to see if we can make it happen!
    
## SBSI: Joining {style="font-size:35px"}

- So, finally, what does joining the SBSI entail?

- To be honest... not a lot! 

- All we need is for members to have at least a small interest in not only statistics and data science, but also an interest in improving the statistics and data science sphere here at UCSB

- We may meet once in a while (depending on how many people end up joining), but being a member shouldn't eat up much of your time.

      I was fortunate enough to serve as a founding member of (and also Secretary for) the Statistics Undergraduate Student Association (SUSA) at UC Berkeley, which is the officially supported student association of the Statistics Department at UC Berkeley. Additionally, I wrote a handful of exam review sheets (that, admittedly, contain some typos!), which can be found on the official SUSA website.

      Duties as a facilitator included judging auditions, organizing the final recitals, and other administrative work.
